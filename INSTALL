- Requirements: CMake

- How to build the software:

We recommend you create a build/ subdir in the tree. Then change into that directory and run e.g.

cmake ../

Where ../ is the relative path to the root of the CBF source tree. Then run

make

and hopefully the software is built allright :D Install with 

make install

If you want to build the included (though quite incomplete) documentation issue the 
following command:

make doxy 

before running 

make install
