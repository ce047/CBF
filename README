- Literature

To be filled in..

- Requirements

  - A C++ compiler that likes templates

  - the BOOST libs including the BOOST Numeric UBLAS package

- Optional Requirements

  - KDL, for KDL based inverse and forward kinematics

  - libpa10, for operating the pa10 robot arm

  - xsd, a xml schema to c++ translator. This is needed if 
    you want to be able to create controllers automatically
    from XML files

  - libxerces-c++ 2.6 or higher

  - Python C API and boost.pythonÂ¸ the BOOST python bindings, 
    if you would like to be able to prototype new sensor/
    effector transforms or potential functions using 
    python code embedded into libcbf

  - Doxygen, for building the documentation
